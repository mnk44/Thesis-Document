  abstract  = {The article deals with the issues of digital interaction of the state with citizens and organizations. The importance of digital support for solving various life situations is shown. A methodology that allows calculating the level of digital maturity of public services was presented. The article substantiates the importance of proactivity in the provision of public services and suggests networks of expert systems as a tool for implementing proactivity in this area. The authors introduce the basic concepts used in modelling expert systems and their networks and present the structure and operation scheme of a network of expert systems. The topology of the network of expert systems was designed to determine the category of the recipient and, accordingly, the public services that belong to this category, according to the life situation ``Birth of a child''. The network of expert systems was tested using various forms of questionnaires. Based on the results of testing, positive results were obtained and the advantages of using networks of expert systems in comparison with a single multi-level expert system were described. The prospects for the development of expert systems networks and the possibility of their use for solving various tasks are considered.},

  abstract  = {Predicting the performance of students is one of the most important topics required for learning contexts such as colleges and universities, as it helps to design successful mechanisms that boost tutorial outcomes and prevent dropouts among various items. These are benefited by automating the many processes involved in the activities of usual students which handle huge volumes of information collected from package tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, the careful analysis and interpretation of these information would provide us with valuable data regarding the data of the students and therefore the relationship between them and hence the tutorial tasks. This data is the supply which feeds promising algorithms and methods able to estimate the success of the students. During this analysis, virtually many papers were analysed to show radically different trendy techniques widely applied to predict the success of students, along with the goals they need to achieve in this area. These computing-related techniques and approaches are mainly machine learning techniques, deep learning techniques, Artificial Neural Networks &amp; Neural Networks Convolution, etc. This paper demonstrates the analysis and their comparisons of various methods used to forecast Student Academic success.},

  abstract = {Learning style plays a vital role in helping students retain learned concepts for a longer time and also improves the understanding of the concepts. Learning styles in offline and online scenarios are recognized using questionnaires. The recent trend is to identify and use attributes to detect the learning style of the learner automatically without disturbing the learner. The paper is an extension of the authors' earlier work with some changes to the methodology. In this paper, the authors have identified new attributes and scaled-down the attributes identified earlier, which would help identify the learner's learning style. The authors implemented classification algorithms and compared the accuracy of the different algorithms on the dataset. Various interesting patterns are observed in learner's behaviour while learning different types of concepts in different situations.},
